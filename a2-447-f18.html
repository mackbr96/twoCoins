<H2><font color=gray>A Tale of Two Coins</font></H2>
<b>Out</b>: October 2, 2018.
<br>

<hr>

Alice has two coins that she can flip at any time. The two coins have distinct probabilities
of showing Heads/Tails. 
Bob observes the outcomes of Alice's coin tosses but unfortunately he does not which coin Alice 
is tossing at any time (since both coins look alike). We assume Alice knows which coin is which
at all times.

<p>

But Bob knows Alice's tendencies in choosing the coins. For example, suppose the coins
are called coins X and Y, respectively. If Alice tosses coin X in the current step, then
in the next step she will toss X again with probability 0.75 and will toss coin Y otherwise 
(with probability 0.25).
On the other hand, if she tosses coin Y, she will choose to toss coin X in the next step with
probability 0.9 and toss coin Y again with probability only 0.1. This can be represented as a
probability transition matrix:
<pre>
0.75  0.9
0.25  0.1
</pre> 
where the first row and column is indexed by X and the second row/column is indexed by Y.

<p>

Bob also knows the "biases" of the two coins (although he can not tell them apart). 
For example, coin X shows Heads (H) or Tails (T) with equal probabilities 0.4 and 0.6, respectively.
But coin Y shows Heads (H) with probability 0.8 and shows Tails (T) with probability 0.2.
This can be represented as two sequences (or vectors):
<pre>
0.4  0.8
</pre>
Note: we need only record the probabilities of showing Heads for each coin.

<p>

Now, suppose Bob observed a sequence of tosses, say:
<pre>
HTHTHHHHTHTTHTHTHHTHHHHTHHTHTHHTTTH
</pre>
His goal is to determine how Alice had chosen her sequence of coins. Or rather find the
sequence of choices made by Alice that is most likely. For example,
<pre>
XYXYXYXXXYXYXYYYYXYXYXYXYXYXYYYYXXX
</pre>
is a particular sequence of choices that could have been made by Alice (but this might
not be the most likely sequence).

<hr>

Write a program that takes three input text files. The first file contains the probability
transition matrix of Alice's tendencies. The second file contains the biases (probability of
showing Heads) of the coins. The third file contains the sequence of outcomes from Alice's
coin tosses. 

<p>

The program should output a single text file containing the most likely sequence
of coins that Alice had used in producing the outcome sequence of tosses.

<p>

For simplicity, use 1 to represent H and 0 to represent T. Also, use integers to represent
the coins: say 0 for X and 1 for Y.

<p>
